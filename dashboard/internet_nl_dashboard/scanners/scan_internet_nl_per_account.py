# done: make nice tracking name for internet nl that is echoed in the scan results.
# done: map web scans to endpoints
# done: check status of scan using each individual account
# done: possibly we need to check all relevant endpoints before starting the scan. This makes sure that all
#       latest changes have been picked up. Especially if manual scans will happen a lot. Probably just adding
#       a task before registering a scan. This might deliver some problems as we've seen before, with a chord
#       not being performed after the other task has finished. This might be a bit challenging.
#       Indeed: a chord does not work. A chain might. We can verify url filters when there is a larger set of domains.
#       Done: How do we get the correct list of urls at the time we're going to scan? We've to make that a task too.
#       Done: This is done using chains, where each step is executed in order.
# done: create a function for this, as it is twice the same code.
# todo: probably the urllist will contain information if a scan will be done for web or mail. This cannot be managed
#       yet, so this is not implemented yet.
# Todo: add the scan ID to the report, so it's easier to find which scan is what. Is that possible?

    This monitors the state of a dashboard scan. Depending on the state, it determines if an action is needed and
    gathers them. This will not handle errors.

    This is used in conjunction with Celery: all tasks are performed async, which scales better.

    Steps are split into two: the active verb and the past tense verb. When something is happening, the active verb
    is used, otherwise the past tense verb. Such as: "scanning endpoints" and "scanned endpoints".
        An active verb means that something is currently being performed.
        A completed / past tense verb means that the process is ready to move on.

    All active verbs have a timeout. This timeout can be different for each verb. The timeout is set to a value that
    takes into account the possibility of the system being very busy and all queues full. Therefore, something that
    usually would last 10 seconds, will have a timeout of several hours. If this timeout triggers, there is something
    very wrong: either an unexpected exception stopped the process or there are deadlocks in the queues.
        These timeouts should never be triggered: if they do, it will mean manual intervention to fix a bug etc.

    When a timeout is reached on an active verb, it will change the state to something that is not processed in this
    monitor anymore. Manual action is required, after the manual action has been performed, the person handling it
    can set the state of the failed scan to something this process understands, and we'll happily try again.
        Note that celery can also perform several attempts on exceptions etc, this might or might not happen.
        Timeouts are stored as the following: timeout on [active verb]: timeout on scanning endpoints.

    To prevent duplicate tasks from spawning, this method will adjust the task before the actual content is called.

    This does not use django fsm, as that ties everything to a model. It also overcomplicates the process with
    branching and such. The on-error feature is nice though.

    Urls that cannot be scanned using the internet.nl website are not allowed to be scanned. This is where endpoint
    detection comes into view. Only domains with valid endpoints are (should) be scanned. Other domains have to
    be ignored.

    Yet, when we publish a list of "top 500" domains, only 499 show up in the report. This is due to a number of
    complications.

    1: some domains show up where it is stated that the requirements for scanning where not met. Yet, somehow,
    this domain is in the report while it shouldn't be. This seems to be a bug in the reporting engine (todo) that
    tries to retrieve all results, and if the domain has another endpoint, it is added to the report (alas empty).
    These empty domains are accounted for, and are displayed correctly in the report as being ignored.

    2: some domains do not have any endpoints, such as megaupload.com. Also these should not be scanned.
    These domains however short be reflected in the report, the same as the domains that have a single endpoint.

    To account for these issues, after report generation an extra step is needed that upgrades the report. (There
    already is report upgrading code.) The upgrade will check if all domains are in the report, and if not, add
    the url as being empty. This way all urls that are requested are in the report, and if they are empty, they
    are ignored in all statistics.
