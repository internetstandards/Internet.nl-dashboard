When <code>_domainkey.example.nl</code> is an 'empty non-terminal' some name servers that are not conformant with the standard<a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2308\">RFC 2308</a> incorrectly answer <code>NXDOMAIN</code> instead of <code>NOERROR</code>.

In many cases these modifications are harmless. Examples are whitespace replacement and header field line rewrapping.

The <code>simple</code> setting tolerates almost no modifications, and <code>relaxed</code> tolerates common modifications. If no setting is specified it defaults to <code>simple</code> for both header and body. In particular, header modifications are a common cause of a DKIM signature unintentionally becoming invalid, thus hindering deliverability. Using <code>relaxed</code> for the header while keeping <code>simple</code> for the body (<code>c=relaxed/simple</code>), can mitigate these kind of issues.</li><li>For a \"good practice on domains without mail\" see the <a href=\"#control-panel-9\">explanation of the \"DMARC policy\" subtest</a>.</li></ul>",

Next to the mentioned values <code>'report-sample'</code> could be there in case you want code samples to be sent together with the 'violation reports'.</li><li>The <code>base-uri</code> directive should be defined and its value should be either <code>'none'</code>,  or <code>'self'</code> and/or one or more URLs of the domain itself (including its subdomain or superdomain).

This restricts the URLs which can be used as the target of form submissions.</li><li>The source values <code>unsafe-eval</code>, <code>unsafe-inline</code> and <code>unsafe-hashes</code> should <em>not</em> be used, because these enable XSS attacks. </li><li>The <code>data:</code> scheme should <em>not</em> be used in the <code>default-src</code>, <code>script-src</code> and <code>object-src</code> directives, because this enables XSS attacks.</li><li>A domain with the <code>http://</code> scheme or a domain without a scheme should <em>not</em> be used, because this enables sources to be downloaded over an insecure connection. Use the <code>https://</code> scheme instead.</li><li>A wildcard (i.e. <code>*</code>) for the full host part of a URL should <em>not</em> be used in any directive, because this allows for any external source.

Therefore we check for HSTS on the first contact i.e. before any redirect.</p><p>HSTS forces a web browser to connect directly via HTTPS when revisiting your website. This helps preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. We consider a HSTS cache validity period of <em>at least</em> 1 year (<code>max-age=31536000</code>) to be sufficiently secure. A long period is beneficial because it also protects infrequent visitors. However if you want to stop supporting HTTPS (which is generally a poor idea), you will have to wait longer until the validity of the HSTS policy in all browsers that visited your website, has expired. </p><p>The test does <strong>not</strong> check whether <code>preload</code> is used and whether the domain is included in the <a href=\"https://hstspreload.org/\">HSTS Preload List</a>.</p><hr /><p><strong>Deployment recommendation</strong></p><p>HSTS requires your website to fully work over HTTPS. This also includes having a valid certificate from a publicly trusted certificate authority. So when your website does not properly support HTTPS, note that it will <em>not be reachable</em> by browsers that have contacted your website before. A HSTS policy change to revert effects will not have immediate effect for these browsers since they have cached your previous HSTS policy. </p><p>Therefore we advise you to follow the implementation steps below:</p><ol><li>Make sure that the website on your domain fully works over HTTPS now and in the future (e.g. by having a solid certificate rollover procedure);</li><li><p>Increase the HSTS cache validity period in the stages below. During each stage, carefully check for reachability issues and broken pages. Fix any issues that come up and then wait the full max-age of the stage before moving to the next stage. </p></li><li><p>Start with 5 minutes (<code>max-age=300</code>);</p></li><li>Increase it to 1 week (<code>max-age=604800</code>);</li><li>Increase it to 1 month (<code>max-age=2592000</code>);</li><li><p>Increase it to 1 year (<code>max-age=31536000</code>) or more.</p></li><li><p>Repeat step 1 and 2 for every single subdomain that you want to secure with HSTS. Only use <code>includeSubDomains</code> if you are fully sure that <strong>all</strong> the (nested) subdomains of your domain properly support HTTPS now and in the future.</p></li><li>Use <code>preload</code> <strong>only</strong> if you are very sure that you want your domain to be included in the <a href=\"https://hstspreload.org/\">HSTS Preload List</a>. HSTS preloading is mostly interesting for highly sensitive websites. Administrators who want to enable HSTS preloading for a particular domain should do so with extreme caution.

If there are multiple overlapping route announcements for the IP address, we test that they are all <code>Valid</code>.</p><p>Your hoster (or its network provider) announces via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for which of its IP address blocks it accepts incoming Internet traffic. It does this by associating (parts of) its IP address blocks (Route Prefix) with the unique number of its provider network (Route Origin ASN), and then distributing this routing information. Other network providers use these route announcements to determine via which route to send traffic for the IP addresses.</p><p>Additionally, for each route announcement, your hoster (or its network provider) should publish a digitally signed statement with route authorisation (Route Origin Authorisation; abbreviated: ROA) statement using Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). </p><p>Another network provider that is asked to send Internet traffic to your server's IP address can cryptographically verify the associated statement. The verified content (Validated ROA Payload; abbreviated: VRP) includes which provider networks (VRP ASN) are authorised to receive Internet traffic for each recorded IP address block (VRP Prefix). </p><p>The network provider can then use this content to filter BGP routes. For example, he can reject any <code>Invalid</code> routes, to prevent Internet traffic from its network is  sent to unauthorised provider networks.</p><p>Checking route announcements against route authorisations (RPKI Origin Validation; abbreviated: ROV) has the following three possible outcomes.</p><p>1․ <code>Valid</code>: The route announcement of the considered IP address is matched by at least one published route authorisation. A route authorisation is also matched for more specific route announcements (i.e., for a part of the IP address block contained in the route authorisation), unless they are more specific than the limit specified in the route authorisation (via the <code>maxLength</code> attribute). </p><p>2․ <code>Invalid</code>: The route announcement of the considered IP address is covered by a route authorisation, but it does <em>not</em> match. There are two possible causes:</p><ul><li>the IP address block (Route Prefix) is announced from a provider network (Route Origin ASN) that is <em>not</em> authorised in the route authorisation (result in the table below: \"invalid (as)\");</li><li>the IP address block (Route Prefix) that is announced is <em>smaller than is allowed</em> in the route authorisation, i.e. exceeding <code>maxLength</code> value (result in table below: \"invalid (length)\").</li></ul><p>3․ <code>NotFound</code>: No statement with route-authorisation has been found that covers the route announcement of the considered IP address. This makes the routing of Internet traffic to your server less secure. Please contact your hoster about this. He can ask his network provider that owns your server's IP addresses to publish route authorisations.</p><p><strong>What to do if the test result shows the status Invalid?</strong></p><p>The status <code>Invalid</code> indicates an unintentional or malicious route configuration error, that can be caused by your hoster or its network provider (internal error) or by a third party (external error). In either case, it increases the risk for unreachability of your server or for interception of Internet traffic to your server. Contact your hoster as soon as possible.
